# About
This is a simple thing that I did to test git on my Raspberry Pi.  The aim of this was not to create an innovative or original program, just to this git test.
# Setup
If you want to do what I did, then create a repo with a simple program like this one.  Then, ssh into your pi by doing this (if you don't have Windows).
```bash
ssh (your Raspberry Pis username, the default is pi)@(the ip address of your Pi)
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/johnlbullock/Python_Pi_Test.git
cd Python_Pi_Test
sudo python Python_Pi_Test.p
```
